        MUN
        <br />
        Model United Nations (MUN) simulations are exercises for those
        interested in learning more about the UN. Students from different
        backgrounds participate in these conferences to get a taste of politics
        and build their oratory skills. It is a great way to build your
        confidence and learn to find radical solutions to problems of global
        importance.

        The PICT MUN Club, established in 2016, consists of a group of
        inquisitive students who are passionate about social, political, and
        economic issues that elude the future of our world. PICT MUN strongly
        believes in the important role of dialogue and discussion in solving any
        problem and hence always abides by its motto - 'Think.Discuss.Prosper.'{" "}

        CONFERENCE <br />
        <br />
        We are organizing our annual MUN conference on the 15th and 16th of
        October, 2022, to assist in the cause of achieving a better
        understanding of the United Nations. It will help you develop your
        leadership, writing, public speaking, and problem-solving skills and
        express your point of view. Through this conference, we wish to
        inculcate the habit of research and understanding of devising radical
        solutions to universal subjects.
