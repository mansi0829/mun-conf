        United Nations is the body that aims to maintain international peace and
        security and promote the well-being of all the people. Peace is what
        should be advocated in order to bring stability and cooperation amongst
        nations around the world. While technology and development soar at the
        current rate, humanity should evolve to keep up. Otherwise, the effects
        could be disastrous.
        <br />
        <br />
        The pandemic and the post-pandemic world has witnessed many such issues.
        <br />
        With the catastrophic impact of climate change currently at various
        locations on the globe, the unexpected turn of events resulting in wars,
        political and diplomatic tensions amongst the nations, terrorism gaining
        power in certain countries, and the communally volatile environment in
        our own country. With all this taking place around the world, now is the
        most urgent need to not just talk about these issues but to talk about
        finding solutions to them.
        <br />
        <br />
        MUNs have always been a great place to put forth new ideas and develop
        them taking into account the benefits of all the different countries and
        PICTMUN has always been promoted to be one such platform. It aspires to
        bring forth opinions and discussions to build up a fruitful debate and
        understanding of worldly issues. The ultimate aim is to try and build
        innovative solutions to help address these problems. <br />
        <br />
        It is the fifth edition of our conference and has required rigorous
        efforts from the Secretariat and all other members of the Organising
        Committee to give you an opportunity to voice your opinions on various
        agendas curated after much thought.
        <br />
        MUN is a thorough experience where delegates come together not only to
        uphold the above cause but also to nurture their public speaking and
        debating skills and sharpen the art of diplomacy that underlies most of
        the decisions made at the UN on the international scene. <br />
        <br />
        It is my honor to welcome you to the PICT Model United Nations 2022! And
        I look forward to great discussions and talks.
        <br />
        <br />
        Regards
        <br />
        Hetavi Gandhi,
        <br />
        Secretary-General,
        <br />
        PICTMUN.
